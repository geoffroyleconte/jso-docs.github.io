# Ecosystems

Our packages can be divided into three non-exclusive ecosystems:
- [Linear Algebra](/pages/ecosystem/linear-algebra/): Packages for dealing with matrices and matrix-like objects. For instance, for solving linear systems, or linear least-squares problems.
- [Models](/pages/ecosystem/models/): Packages that define and access optimization models.
- [Solvers](/pages/ecosystem/solvers/): Packages related to our solvers and the development of other solvers.
